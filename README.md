# Providence Mod for Subway Builder

First Download Instructions:
1. In Subway Builder, go to Settings > Mod Manager and click on "Open Mods Folder".
2. Unzip (extract) the archive into the folder that opened.
Note: The ZIP file contains the files directly (without a root folder), so make sure you extract them into a folder named Sacramento inside your mods folder (often done by default by extraction software).


FOR THOSE WHO DON"T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AND JUST WANT TO RUN THE MAP:

On MacOS or Linux: Open the "Terminal" application. Type in "sh" and a space, and then drag "run_mac-linux.sh" into the terminal. (Make sure there is a space between "sh" and the file). Press enter and you are ready to play the map! (Make sure to do this before playing it every time).

On Windows: Double-click "run_windows.bat". Make sure to run this everytime before you play this map!


Subway Builder mod that adds a detailed map of Sacramento (SMF) and some of its surrounding areas.
